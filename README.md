# Periodic Tables - Restaurant Reservation System
## Capstone Project for Thinkful Engineering Immersion Program

### [Live link to deployed application](https://reservations-frontend.herokuapp.com/dashboard)

Periodic Tables is a full stack reservation system for fine dining restaurants. This software would be used internally by restaurant staff to organize reservations and table seating. The user can enter reservations, cancel and adjust reservations, seat reservations at specific tables, change table status and look up reservations by phone number.

This project was built with JavaScript, React.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL in conjuction with VSCode, Postman, DBeaver, ElephantSQL, Knex, and Heroku. The API is RESTful and can execute all CRUDL operations.

This repository is set up as a monorepo, meaning that the frontend and backend projects are in one repository.

   - `created_at`: string (formatted YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z)
   - `updated_at`: string (formatted YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z)
   - `reservation_id`: integer

**Create a table**: `POST /tables`
- Posts one table
- Post body must contain `table_name` and `capacity` (see above for data types)
- Database will then create `table_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` and `reservation_id` fields (`reservation_id` defaults to null)
- Successful POST request will return JSON of the posted table

**Get one table**: `GET /tables/:table_id`
- Gets one table based on table_id parameter
- Successful GET request will return JSON of the table

**Update one table's reservation assignment**: `PUT /tables/:table_id/seat`
- Updates `reservation_id` of one table based on `table_id` parameter
- Request body must contain a `reservation_id` key with a string value
- Successful PUT request will return JSON of the updated table

**Delete one table's reservation assignment**: `DELETE /tables/:table_id/seat`
